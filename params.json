{"name":"Bastl","tagline":"bastl library for bastl-instruments.com","body":"Bastl library for Arduino includes utilities for joining the Mozzi library, includes necessary files to make the source code compile for Bastl Instruments softwares.\r\n\r\nAs Examples included in the library you find the softwares that would run on Trinity synth. You need to install the [Mozzi](http://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/) and the [MIDI library for Arduino](http://sourceforge.net/projects/arduinomidilib/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bastl Instruments \r\nis new brand for electronic hand-made musical instrument which continues the instruments tradition set up by Standuino. We are the same people and we believe that by focusing on musical instruments only we are able to achieve higher quality and innovation. The word Bastl refers very often to DIY electronics in Czech language, but also includes different forms of funny DIY.\r\n\r\n## Trinity \r\nis open musical instrument bringing the power of digital instruments and their development to wider Bastl public. It runs Atmega 328 chip reprogrammable by Arduino IDE and ready to run Mozzi library.\r\n\r\nTrinity is open for any sort of hacks, and we will document them and make instructables for them. We are hoping to also implement some of the future hacks into the official Bastl softwares. You can hack the existing softwares or start your own synth software from scratch using the Mozzi library to output sound. Because Trinity is based on Arduino you can use the whole world of it to interface literally anything with it. It is hackable in hardware so you can connect sensors or motors to it or sync it to anything. The softwares and examples are written in structured form so they read and change them easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

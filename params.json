{"name":"Bastl","tagline":"bastl library for bastl-instruments.com","body":"Bastl library for Arduino includes utilities for joining the Mozzi library, includes necessary files to make the source code compile for Bastl Instruments softwares.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Examples included in the library you find the softwares that would run on Trinity synth. \r\nCurrently there are MONO FM synth, POLY synth, DRUM and SQNCR. \r\nNote: the examples might not be the latest versions of these softwares. Please check their own [repositories](https://github.com/bastl-instruments/) to get the latest versions.\r\n\r\nTo install the Bastl library download the repository (link on the left), unpack it, rename folder name simply to \"bastl\" and copy it to \"libraries\" folder of your Arduino IDE.\r\nYou also need to install the [Mozzi](http://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/) and the [MIDI library for Arduino](http://sourceforge.net/projects/arduinomidilib/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bastl Instruments \r\nis new brand for electronic hand-made musical instrument which continues the instruments tradition set up by Standuino. We are the same people and we believe that by focusing on musical instruments only we are able to achieve higher quality and innovation. The word Bastl refers very often to DIY electronics in Czech language, but also includes different forms of funny DIY.\r\n\r\nFor more information go to [www.bastl-instruments.com](http://www.bastl-instruments.com/)\r\n\r\n## Trinity \r\nis open musical instrument bringing the power of digital instruments and their development to wider Bastl public. It runs Atmega 328 chip reprogrammable by Arduino IDE and ready to run Mozzi library.\r\n\r\nTrinity is open for any sort of hacks, and we will document them and make instructables for them. We are hoping to also implement some of the future hacks into the official Bastl softwares. You can hack the existing softwares or start your own synth software from scratch using the Mozzi library to output sound. Because Trinity is based on Arduino you can use the whole world of it to interface literally anything with it. It is hackable in hardware so you can connect sensors or motors to it or sync it to anything. The softwares and examples are written in structured form so they read and change them easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/3.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br /><span xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" href=\"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Dataset\" property=\"dct:title\" rel=\"dct:type\">Bastl Library</span> by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"http://www.bastl-instruments.com/\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">Václav Peloušek for Bastl Instruments</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License</a>.<br />Based on a work at <a xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" href=\"http://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/\" rel=\"dct:source\">http://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/</a>.<br />Permissions beyond the scope of this license may be available at <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"http://www.bastl-instruments.com/\" rel=\"cc:morePermissions\">http://www.bastl-instruments.com/</a>.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
